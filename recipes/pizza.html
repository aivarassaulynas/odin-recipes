    <h2>Tasty Pizza Margherita with Tomato</h2>
    <p>When it comes to toppings for this Margherita pizza, less is more, especially with sauce. And when you spread the sauce on the dough, it's key to leave a 1-inch border around the edge to ensure the perfect mozzarella pizza.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>One portion Perfect Neapolitan Pizza Dough</li>
        <li>1/2 cup Perfect Pizza Sauce</li>
        <li>1/4 pound thinly sliced fresh mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>10 fresh basil leaves</li>
        <li>Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling</li>
        <li>Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, for grating</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps to make:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Set a pizza stone on a rack in the top third of the oven. Preheat the oven to 500° for at least 45 minutes. Meanwhile, remove the dough ball from the refrigerator and let stand for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Working on a floured surface and using your fingers, press and stretch the dough ball out to a 10-inch round, working from the center toward the edge; avoid pressing on the outermost edge. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured pizza peel. Spread the Pizza Sauce onto the dough, making sure to leave a 1-inch border around the edge, and top with the mozzarella cheese, basil leaves, a drizzle of the extra-virgin olive oil and a light grating of Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.</li>
        <li>Turn the oven to broil for 5 minutes, then return it to 500°. Slide the pizza onto the pizza stone, opening and closing the oven door as quickly as possible. Bake until the bottom is lightly charred and the toppings are bubbling, about 6 minutes for a chewier crust and 8 minutes for a crispier one; avoid opening the oven door during baking.</li>
    </ol>
